Object Oriented Programming (MCQ + Coding + Interview) ********
---------------------------
1. Java is a class based language.
2. Java class consist 5 elements:
    1. Variables
    2. Methods
    3. Constructors
    4. BLocks
    5. Inner Class (Nested Class)

Example:
    class <class-name>
    {
        1. Variables
        2. Methods
        3. Constructors
        4. BLocks
        5. Inner Class (Nested Class)
    }

3. Variables
a. Variables are used to store data/value.
Example:
    int rollno = 101;
    where 'rollno' is a variable that stores 101 (data/value/constant).

b. There are 3 types of variables in java.
    * Local Variables
        |- LV are define inside the M/C/B.
        |- Calling of LV depend on: When M/C/B call
        |- Memory Allocation: Stack
    * Instance Variables
        |- IV are define inside the class but outside the M/C/B.
        |- Calling of IV depend on: object
        |- Memory Allocation: Heap
        |- How many times memory will create: depend upon no. of object, if we have
           3 object of a class then 3 time memory will create for single IV.
    * Static Variable
        |- SV are define inside the class but outside the M/C/B with prefix 'static'.
        |- Calling of SV depend on: class
        |- Memory Allocation: Non-Heap
        |- How many times memory will create: one time.

    Program1.java
