Object Oriented Programming (MCQ + Coding + Interview) ********
---------------------------
1. Java is a class based language.
2. Java class consist 5 elements:
    1. Variables
    2. Methods
    3. Constructors
    4. BLocks
    5. Inner Class (Nested Class)

Example:
    class <class-name>
    {
        1. Variables
        2. Methods
        3. Constructors
        4. BLocks
        5. Inner Class (Nested Class)
    }

3. Variables
a. Variables are used to store data/value.
Example:
    int rollno = 101;
    where 'rollno' is a variable that stores 101 (data/value/constant).

b. There are 3 types of variables in java.
    * Local Variables
        |- LV are define inside the M/C/B.
        |- Calling of LV depend on: When M/C/B call
        |- Memory Allocation: Stack
    * Instance Variables
        |- IV are define inside the class but outside the M/C/B.
        |- Calling of IV depend on: object
        |- Memory Allocation: Heap
        |- How many times memory will create: depend upon no. of object, if we have
           3 object of a class then 3 time memory will create for single IV.
    * Static Variable
        |- SV are define inside the class but outside the M/C/B with prefix 'static'.
        |- Calling of SV depend on: class
        |- Memory Allocation: Non-Heap
        |- How many times memory will create: one time.

c. Example:
    Program1.java


4. Methods
a. Methods are used to write the logics of the program.
a1. Unit testing apply on methods only.
b. There are two types of methods
    |- Instance Methods or Non-static Methods
    |- Static Methods

Examples:
    Program2

Calling Rules
-------------
1. Instance methods ---Directly---> Instance methods/variables.
2. Static methods ---Object---> Instance methods/variables.
3. Instance methods ---Classname---> Static methods/variables
4. Static methods ---Classname---> Static methods/variables

Examples:
    Program3

Q. How to create object of a class
A. There are 4 ways
        |- Named Object
        |- Nameless Object
        |- Instance Factory Method (later)
        |- Static Factory Method   (later)
-------------------------------
        |- Named Object
        Syntax:
            class-name obj-name = new constructor-name();
        Example:
            Program4 obj1 = new Program4();

        |- Nameless Object
        Syntax:
             new constructor-name();
        Example:
             new Program4();

Example:
    Program4
    Program5


6. Constructors
---------------
1. Constructor is a special type of method which is invoked implicitly at the
   time of object creation.
2. It is used to initialize objects.
3. It is also used to initialize Instance variables by using default values.
    Data-type                   Default values
    -----------------------------------------
    byte,short,int,long          0
    float,double                 0.0
    boolean                      false
    char                          (1 space)
    String                       null
    -----------------------------------------
4. Types of Constructors
    |- Default Constructors [Compiler]
        |- Zero Parameterized

    |- User Defined Constructors [User]
        |- Zero or more than Zero Parameterized

5. Constructor-name and class-name should be same.
6. Constructors are able to pass parameters.
7. Constructor doesn't have any return-type.

8. Examples
    Program12

    Program15: Difference b/w implicit and explicit calling
    Program16: How constructor used to initialized IV.
    Program17:
    Program18:
    Program21: 'this' keyword : It represent as current class object.
                |- We can use 'this' keyword with
                            |- variables
                            |- methods
                            |- constructors
                                |- 'this' should be first statement in constructor
    Program22:


7. Blocks
---------
a. Blocks are used to write common logics.
b. Types of blocks:
        |- Instance Block
            |- syntax:
                        {
                            //statements
                        }
            |- IB logics are common for all objects.
            |- IB executes at the time of object creation.

        |- Static Block
            |- syntax:
                        static{
                            //statments
                        }
            |- SB logics are common for whole class.
            |- SB execute at the time of .class file loaded.

C. Example:
    Program23
    Program24

8. Inner class
--------------
a. Class inside another class is known as Inner class.
b. Non-static nested class is Inner class.
Syntax:

    class Outer
    {
        ....

        class Inner
        {
            .....
        }
    }

c. Inner class can access all the members/elements of Outer class.

Examples:
    Outer1
