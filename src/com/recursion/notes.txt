Recursion **********
---------
1. Method calling itself directly or indirectly.
2. Types of Recursion
         |- Indirect Recursion
            A() ---> B() ---> C() ----> A()
        *|- Direct Recursion
                |- Tail Recursion
                |- Head Recursion
                |- Tree Recursion
                |- Nested Recursion
3. If we stop the recursive calling,so we can use base condition

Tail Recursion
--------------
1. If a recursive calling statement is the last statement in the method, so we can
   say that Tail recursion.
2. Approach: Top-Down Approach
Example:
    Program1

Head Recursion
---------------
1. If a recursive calling statement is the first statement in the method, so we can
      say that Head recursion.
2. Approach: Bottom-Up Approach
Example:
    Program2

Tree Recursion
---------------
1. If there are more than one recursive calling statement in the method, so we can say
that Tree Recursion.
2. Approach: Tree
Example:
    Program3

Nested Recursion
-----------------
1. Recursive calling statement inside the argument of recursive calling statement.

Example:
    Program6
